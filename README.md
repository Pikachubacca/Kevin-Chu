CIS -18A final project (Restaurant Business)

Program description: A program that displays the cost and ingredients in your sub that you customize from Joe's World Famous Sub Emporium

Who is it for? 
This program is for the restaraunt "Joe's World Famous Sub Emporium" that specializes in making subs. The program is designed to streamline the ordering process for customers to make it relatively easy. It is mainly for the customers of this restaraunt.

What is its purpose? 
The purpose of my ordering program is for a simple ordering service for the sub shop to sell sub sandwiches. It is for customers the option to use rather than going to the cashier or whoever is working the front of the shop. 

What is its business function?
It is to streamline the ordering process with easy simple instructions and a logical ordering process. This can help the business save money on cashiers or allow more ease of access for customers when lines might be backed up and help the workers recieve the orders and immediately work on the custom sub instead of waiting for the customer to think while ordering.

What is its technical function?
The technical function of the program is for the user or customer to input certain options into the system so that the program can read and calculate the cost of the sub that the customer ordered and display their order on the screen. It incorporates arrays, for loops, if else statements to achieve the desired results. You can choose from 3 bread choices, and 4 toppings. 

How to use:
Compile the java files 
Run SubCost and follow the instructions you see that pop up.
Try and figure out discount codes from my source code.
You should see your custom sub and price of your order.
